# CANDEL

CANDEL (Calibration and Normalization of the Distance Ladder) is a JAX-based framework for calibrating the cosmic distance ladder and modeling velocity fields using observables such as Tullyâ€“Fisher galaxies, supernovae, and cluster scaling relations. It leverages NumPyro for probabilistic programming and provides tools for Bayesian inference and model comparison.


## Installation
```
git clone git@github.com:Richard-Sti/CANDEL.git

# Go to the cloned directory
cd CANDEL

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv_candel
source venv_candel/bin/activate
python -m pip install --upgrade pip && python -m pip install --upgrade setuptools

# Finally install the cloned package
python -m pip install -e .
```

To enable model evidence computation, install the [harmonic](https://github.com/astro-informatics/harmonic) package.


If the package is not recognised in a notebook, add the project directory to the Python path manually, e.g.:
```
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, "/Users/rstiskalek/Projects/candel")
```
