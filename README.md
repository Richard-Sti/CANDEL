# CANDEL

CANDEL (Calibration and Normalization of the Distance Ladder) is a JAX-based framework for calibrating the cosmic distance ladder and modeling velocity fields using observables such as Tullyâ€“Fisher galaxies, supernovae, and cluster scaling relations. It leverages NumPyro for probabilistic programming and provides tools for Bayesian inference and model comparison.


## TODO

### General
- [ ] Test the effect of galaxy biases. Try linear and quadratic.

$$
1 + b_1 \delta + \frac{b_2}{2} \delta^2
$$


### Hubble Dipole
- Focus the main inference solely on CF4 TFR W1 because of its uniform sky coverage, and then add a set of mock calibration to test if there is any signal.

- [ ] Run the scripts to get results on the data (don't forget to save it in a new folder!)
- [ ] Implement the Boubel likelihood (in part this can explain why they find such lower S8).

### Hubble Calibration
- [ ] Run an inference on the SH0ES calibrated data.
- [ ] Better understand how to implement the calibration.
